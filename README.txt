This is a simple site introducing Ji Changmin or Q. There are four main parts, mapped into the main image. First is the background information which will appear by clicking his face. Second is the short intro with their current comeback which will appear upon clicking the sepia teaser photo with beating heart. Third is preview of their (his and his group's) previous works which will appear once the rotating disk is clicked. Last is the collection of his pet's photos which will appear if Ghana (his dog's) face is clicked.
